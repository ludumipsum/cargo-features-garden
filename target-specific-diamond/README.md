## Target Specific Diamond Dependency

This is a demonstration of surprising behavior that manifests from the interactions between the Feature and Target-Specific Dependency features that manifests as a modified diamond dependency problem. The behavior shown in the naive setup is intended behavior, but it is quite surprising.

_Author's Note: This was the first demonstration I set up for this repository, and it models a real failure I spent a long time tacking down. As such, it may be less focused than other demonstrations in this repository._
